# Website Latency Monitor

This project is a React-based application designed to monitor and display the latency levels of various websites. 

### User Interactions

- **Manage Website Cards**: Users can add, remove, update, and manage website cards for monitoring.
- **Latency Checks**: Users can set and adjust time intervals for latency checks.
- **Latency Thresholds**: Users can define and modify latency thresholds for traffic light color indicators.

### Display and Interface

- **Website Cards**: Each monitored website is represented with a card displaying its name and latency level.
- **Traffic Light System**: A traffic light color system (Green, Orange, Red) is used to indicate latency status.
- **Grid Layout**: All monitored websites are displayed in a grid layout.
- **Adding New Websites**: A '+' button is included as the last grid item for adding new websites. Clicking this button opens a modal for entering details like the website's name and URL.
